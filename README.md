# Umami
A tasty lightweight modpack for Minecraft

## About Umami
Umami was created as a easy to run and simple modpack for members of our discord community. It's intended to be run by those whose computers can't handle the struggle bus of running something like All the Mods or similar.

With a mix of magic, exploration, tech, and quality of life mods the aim of this pack is to be enjoyable enough for everyone to be comfortable finding something to do while still keeping things lightweight. For players not familiar with modding or who just enjoy vanilla there is no punishment for choosing to ignore them.

## Features
**Tech**: Umami realies heavily on the Create mod to handle the bulk of the technical wizards needs. Within the scope of the mod there should be more then enough to challege and bring some new spice to those who are tired of the traditional magic block machines found in other mods.

**Magic**: Currently we are playing around with the idea of bringing in Ars Nouveau, Blood Magic, and Botania as the meat and potatoes of the dish. Each provides it's own play style for players to decide how they want to curse their enemies.

**Quality of Life**: We include many QoL mods such as Iron Chests, JEI, Useful Backpacks, and etc. aimed at making the player's life a little easier.

### Spicy Notes
As things stand now we are still heavily testing this pack and making it available publicly for easy acess to our members. Please understand that many changes or updates are to be expected as we work with our members to ensure the best playing modpack for them.
